First, we need tidyverse to handle data importing and wrangling...

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

survey <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/music-survey.csv")
preferences <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/preferences-survey.csv")

nrow(preferences)
colnames(preferences)
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey)=="What is your pseudonym?"] <- "pseudonym"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey)=="First, we are going to create a pseudonym for you to keep this survey anonymous (more or less). Which pseudonym generator would you prefer?"] <- "which_pseudonym_generator"
```
